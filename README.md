## üöÄ Features

### 1. Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition
- **Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD):** A deep learning-based object detection framework for real-time face detection.
- **ResNet-50:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for generating high-quality feature vectors for facial recognition, ensuring accuracy in vector comparisons.

### 2. Advanced Digital Image Processing
Overcoming hardware limitations with a 0.9 MP laptop camera by applying:
- **Contrast Enhancement:** Clearer visuals for better detection.
- **Edge Sharpening with High-Boost Filtering:** Crisp, high-quality images.
- **Brightness Adjustment:** Improved performance under suboptimal lighting conditions.
- **Noise Reduction:** Histogram analysis for cleaner input images.

### 3. Robust and Efficient System Design
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved 95% similarity match between faces using cosine similarity for vector comparisons.
- **Frame-by-Frame Processing:** Real-time video frame capture, face detection, vector generation, and instant comparison for attendance marking.
- **Secure Database Integration:** PostgreSQL for structured and secure storage of student records and attendance logs.
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Restricts attendance to a single entry per session.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Powered by Flask-SocketIO for instant notifications on the frontend.

### 4. User-Friendly Frontend
- **React-based Dashboard:** Intuitive and visually appealing dashboard for easy navigation and management.
